# Image Processing Project

This project is a simple tool for image processing, 
built using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI, and PIL (Python Imaging Library) for handling image operations.

## Features

- **File Browsing**: Easily browse and select image files from your local storage.
- **Image Processing**: Apply a median filter to the selected image, which can help reduce noise in the image.
